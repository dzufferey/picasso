//(W)ADL: (weak) adequate domain of limit.
// how to define an ideal ?
// this relies on mathematical properties taht cannot be enforce by the type system.
// Therefore the hypothesis and invariants should be made clear in the text ...
/* Summary:
an ADL for set X is a triple (L,\predeq,\gamma) where L is a set of Limits (dijoint from X):
(L1) \gamma: L \cup X -> 2^X such that \gamma(z) is downwards closed for all y in L \cup X,
     and \gamma(x) = \downarraow x for all x in X;
(L2) there is \top s.t. \gamma(\top) = X;
(L3) z \predeq z' <=> \gamma(z) \subseteq \gamma(z');
(L4) for any downward-closed subset D of X, there is a finite subset E of L \cup X s,t \biccup_{e in E} \gamma(e) = D.
a WADL satisfies only (L1), (l2), and (l4).

Alternative view (Finkel, Goubault-Larrecq):

a Notherian space is a topological space where:
every closed subsets satisfy the descending chain condition,
every open subsets satisfy the ascending chain condition,
every subset is compact (...).
Alexandorff topoloy is a topological space in which the intersection of any family of open sets is open.
a dcposet set X is Notherian with its Alexandorff topoloy.
Scott topology on X has as open all upward closed subset U s.t. every directed family of that has a lub in X intersectd U (some member of the family is in U).
the closure of a subset of X is the smallest closed subset containg X.
a closed subset F is irreducible iff F is non-empty and F \subseteq F_1 \cup F_2 then F \subseteq F_1 or F subseteq F_2.
a space X is sober iff every closed subseteq F is the closure of a unique point x (F = \downarrow x)

Ideal completion: S(X), for a noetherian space X:
add all missing limis from directed families.
Also the sobrification of X.

Idl(X) is he smallest WADL on X.
